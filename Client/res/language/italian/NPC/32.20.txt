Lilycove - pearl of the world
Lilycove city
Where the land ends and the sea begins. 
I came from Kanto. 
The Hoenn region is beautiful with all its water and verdant nature. 
There is a strange cove at the edge of town?
My missing Pokemon it came back without me noticing!

Lilycove city harbor
I heard there's a tower somewhere out on a route. 
It's called sky pillar, I hear.
