Re-implement/Implement:
Constants for the messages and magic cookies.
Unban players properly.

Broken/Unused:
Loading screen stays on top in loginscreen while it should dissapear (when alwaysontop == true).
Giving the same item seems to 'crash' the connection (walk through warps, no updates).

Misc:
Unsupported messages seem to block messages from being processed in the client after receiving the answer from the server.
