Re-implement/Implement:
Player Count.
Unban players.
Send alerts.

Broken/Unused:
Trading and battles are completely one sided (MAJOR, issue due to changes in network)
Opening a shop (Received data == null/probably not splittable or plainly sent wrong).
Giving the same item seems to 'crash' the connection (walk through warps, no updates).
Use or give only shows 5 pokes.

Misc:
Unsupported messages seem to block messages from being received on the server.
Connection refused or connecting to an offline server seems to spawn threads and hang the client.
